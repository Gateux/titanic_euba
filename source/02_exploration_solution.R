# VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
#   survival        Survival
# (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
# pclass          Passenger Class
# (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
# sex             Sex
# age             Age
# sibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
# parch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard
# fare            Passenger Fare
# embarked        Port of Embarkation
# ship            Company ship number
# (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
# 
# SPECIAL NOTES:
#   Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
# 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower
# 
# Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
# If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5
# 
# With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
# some relations were ignored.  The following are the definitions used
# for sibsp and parch.
# 
# Sibling:  Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic
# Spouse:   Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)
# Parent:   Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic
# Child:    Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic
# 
# Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
# nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
# only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
# travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
# the definitions do not support such relations.

##### Target ########
## Advice: What is the structure of the variable? or
# How many people died?
train_70$survived %>% table

# Whats survival ratio?
train_70$survived %>% mean

# Which ship crashed?
table(train_70$ship, train_70$survived)

####### Embarked ####

# Again, What is the structure of the variable?
train_70$embarked %>% table # is equal to table(train_70$embarked)
table(train_70$embarked, train_70$survived)

# Does it matter where the people embarked for their survival depends on it? 
table(train_70$embarked, train_70$survived) %>% summary()
# rejecting null hypothesis of independence between embarked and survived so 
# it looks like it does not depends on embarked place if people survived

# OK, it looks like this variable is not so useful, lets visualize little bit

# look at so differences between groups!

# or no? don't forget to think about the scale!
## Advice: Scale
# It is really important on how you are showing data and to whom and 
# which type of analysis you are showing.
# For our case it make sense to use fixed scale of (0, 1) as we are talking 
# about probability of surviving

########## Fare #####

## Advice: Capping
# It seems we have no observations between ticket price of 300 and maximum 500.
# What do you think how many people paid 500? Probably not so much.
# Don't you think it could be only coincidence that those people survived or not?
# We are using statisical methods and they are based on law of big numbers, 
# so we should not rely on small group observations. We will make assumptions 
# that those people paid 300 instead of maximum of 500. Second assumptions could be 
# we will exclude those people from our dataset. You as a modeler need to decide.
#
# How to identify if making assumptions only about maximum value is right?
# Usuallu taking down the maximum is not enough, we will take down whole 1 or 5% of highest data
#
# Same could apply to minimum values. We will not focus on them for now.
train_70$fare[train_70$fare >= quantile(train_70$fare, 0.99)] <- quantile(train_70$fare, 0.99)
